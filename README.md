How can we trigger generative sounds living in a structurally coherent system? This project is my intuitive answer for that. The musical components of every sequence are played randomly based on the possibility of their states. You have two options: basic mode for simply playing music or live mode for a real-time performance. The technical system of this project is inspired from a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain). Change value. Play sequence. Hack it.
