A generative music sequencer built upon the core concept of Markov chain.

### Overview
How can we trigger generative sounds living in a structurally coherent system? This project is my intuitive answer for that. The musical components of every sequence are played randomly based on the possibility of their states. The technical system of this project is inspired from a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain). Details about the project are documented [here](https://www.parkjoohyun.com/Hackers.html).
